            //
            // This phase involves merging triangles into larger convex polygons for the sake
            // of efficiency. If you like, you can temporarily skip to phase 3 and come back
            // later.
            //
            // TODO Next up, you need to merge triangles into larger convex polygons where
            // possible. The greedy strategy you will use involves examining adjacent
            // tris and seeing if they can be merged into one new convex tri.
            //
            // At the beginning of this process, you should make a copy of adjPolys. Continue
            // reading below to see why. You can SHALLOW copy like this:
            // newAdjPolys = new AdjacentPolygons(adjPolys);
            AdjacentPolygons copyAdjPolys = new AdjacentPolygons(adjPolys);
            //
            // Iterate through adjPolys.Keys (type:CommonPolygonEdge) and get the value
            // (type:CommonPolygons) for each key. This structure identifies only one polygon
            // if the edge is a boundary (.IsBarrier), but otherwise .AB and .BA references
            // the adjacent polys. You can also get the .CommonEdge (with vertices .A and .B).
            // (The AB/BA refers to orientation of the common edge AB within each poly
            // relative to the winding of the polygon.)
            // If you have two polygons AB and BA (NOT .IsBarrier), then use
            // MergePolygons() to create a new polygon candidate. You need to
            // check IsConvex() to decide if it's valid.
            // If it is valid, then you need to remove the common edge (and merged polys)
            // from your adjPolys dictionary and also add the new, larger convex poly.
            // And further, you need all the other common edges of the two old merged polys
            // to be updated with the merged version.
            // You actually want to perform the dictionary operations on "newAdjPolys" that
            // you created above. This is because you never want to add/remove items
            // to a data structure that you are iterating over. A slightly more efficient
            // alternative would be to make dedicated add and delete lists and apply them
            // after enumeration is complete.
            // The removal of a common edge can be accomplished with newAdjPolys.Remove().
            // You can add the new merged polygon and update all old poly references with

            // AddPolygon(Polygon p, Polygon replacePolyA, Polygon replacePolyB)
            // Similar to the updates to newAdjPolys, you also want to remove old polys
            // and add the new poly to navMeshPolygons.
